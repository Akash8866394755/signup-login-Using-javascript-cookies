I'm finally here to use my expertise of javascript to construct one more project.
This sign-up and login project is widely used in online applications to verify user authentication.and during the signup process, the user registers to access our website permanently.I'm using the JavaScript cookie, which is a component of the Browser Object Model (BOM) here. We do more tasks using cookies depending on our knowledge.Additionally, servers are required for the implementation of cookies, and I use the XAMPP Control Panel software. This program includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP.I chose the XAMPP control panel software because it allows our PC to function as a server and behave like one.
The animate.style package is used in this project to create amazing and fluid animation.
You have to look at this project and let me know what you think.
